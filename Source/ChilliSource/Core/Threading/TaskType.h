    /// An enum describing the various types of tasks which are available to be
    /// scheduled.
    ///
    /// Small task: A task with a small execution time which should be processed
    /// within a single frame. These have a high priority. Note that small tasks
    /// which take a long time to execute will have a significant negative impact
    /// on performance. Use large tasks where a longer execution time is required.
    ///
    /// Large task: A task with a large execution time which can be processed over
    /// a number of frames and can take several seconds to process. These have a
    /// low priority.
    ///
    /// Main thread task: A small task which is executed on the main thread. This
    /// occurs after the game logic for each frame is executed.
    ///
    /// System thread task: A small task which is executed on the system thread.
    /// These tasks are intended to be for lower-level operations.
    ///
    /// Game logic task: A small task which is executed on a background thread and
    /// is guaranteed to be processed within the game logic stage, prior to
    /// executing the main thread tasks.
    ///
    /// File Task: A large task specifically for processing file input or output.
    /// All background processing of files should use this rather than standard
    /// large tasks.
